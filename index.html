            My name is Ted L Clayton a Full Stack Developer in the making. I have a very diverse background
            in the following industries(health insurance, auto repair, banking, car sales, and live sports 
            streaming). Along the way I've successfully worked alongside and with people with all types
            of personalities. I decided that becoming a full stack developer would provide the opportunity to 
            take care of my family which includes my Labrador Retriever/Great Pyranees Mix "Ace" and unlimited 
            growth. If you have any additional questions please feel free to reach out.
